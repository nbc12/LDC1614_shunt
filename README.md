# LDC1614_shunt
Research program to use an Arduino to read an LDC1614 and relay the data over the serial port.

# Libraries
Also includes a modified copy of the RAK12029_LDC1614 library found at [https://github.com/RAKWireless/RAK12029-LDC1614]. This modification removes the parameters for inductance and capacitance and replaces them with a single parameter for resonant frequency.
